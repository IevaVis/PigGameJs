Pig is a simple dice game.

Each turn, a player rolls a die. The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. The total score from before stays at it is.
If the player rolls two same numbers in a row, both current and points from before disappear.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
